# form.FormController








`FormController` keeps track of all its controls and nested forms as well as the state of them,
such as being valid/invalid or dirty/pristine.

Each form directive creates an instance
of `FormController`.







  




## Methods
### $addControl
Register a control with the form.

Input elements using ngModelController do this automatically when they are linked.








### $removeControl
Deregister a control from the form.

Input elements using ngModelController do this automatically when they are destroyed.








### $setValidity
Sets the validity of a form control.

This method will also propagate to parent forms.








### $setDirty
Sets the form to a dirty state.

This method can be called to add the 'ng-dirty' class and set the form to a dirty
state (ng-dirty class). This method will also propagate to parent forms.








### $setPristine
Sets the form to its pristine state.

This method can be called to remove the 'ng-dirty' class and set the form to its pristine
state (ng-pristine class). This method will also propagate to all the controls contained
in this form.

Setting a form back to a pristine state is often useful when we want to 'reuse' a form after
saving or resetting it.
