# $rootScope


* [$rootScopeProvider](api/angular/provider/$rootScopeProvider)








Every application has a single root scope.
All other scopes are descendant scopes of the root scope. Scopes provide separation
between the model and the view, via a mechanism for watching the model for changes.
They also provide an event emission/broadcast and subscription facility. See the
(developer guide on scopes)[guide/scope].
