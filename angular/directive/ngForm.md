# ngForm








Nestable alias of `form` directive. HTML
does not allow nesting of form elements. It is useful to nest forms, for example if the validity of a
sub-group of controls needs to be determined.

Note: the purpose of `ngForm` is to group controls,
but not to be a replacement for the `<form>` tag with all of its capabilities
(e.g. posting to the server, ...).
