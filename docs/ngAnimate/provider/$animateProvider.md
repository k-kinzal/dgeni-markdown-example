# $animateProvider


* [$animate](api/ngAnimate/service/$animate)








The `$animateProvider` allows developers to register JavaScript animation event handlers directly inside of a module.
When an animation is triggered, the $animate service will query the $animate service to find any animations that match
the provided name value.

Requires the (`ngAnimate`)[api/ngAnimate] module to be installed.

Please visit the (`ngAnimate`)[api/ngAnimate] module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.
