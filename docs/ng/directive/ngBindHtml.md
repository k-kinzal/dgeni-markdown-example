# ngBindHtml








Creates a binding that will innerHTML the result of evaluating the `expression` into the current
element in a secure way.  By default, the innerHTML-ed content will be sanitized using the ($sanitize)[api/ngSanitize/service/$sanitize] service.  To utilize this functionality, ensure that `$sanitize`
is available, for example, by including (<code>ngSanitize</code>)[api/ngSanitize] in your module's dependencies (not in
core Angular.)  You may also bypass sanitization for values you know are safe. To do so, bind to
an explicitly trusted value via ($sce.trustAsHtml)[api/ng/service/$sce#trustAsHtml].  See the example
under (Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE))[api/ng/service/$sce#Example].

Note: If a `$sanitize` service is unavailable and the bound value isn't explicitly trusted, you
will have an exception (instead of an exploit.)
