# script








Load the content of a `<script>` element into (`$templateCache`)[api/ng/service/$templateCache], so that the
template can be used by (`ngInclude`)[api/ng/directive/ngInclude],
(`ngView`)[api/ngRoute/directive/ngView], or (directives)[guide/directive]. The type of the
`<script>` element must be specified as `text/ng-template`, and a cache name for the template must be
assigned through the element's `id`, which can then be used as a directive's `templateUrl`.
