# $rootElement











The root element of Angular application. This is either the element where (ngApp)[api/ng/directive/ngApp] was declared or the element passed into
(<code>angular.bootstrap</code>)[api/ng/function/angular.bootstrap]. The element represents the root element of application. It is also the
location where the application's ($injector)[api/auto/service/$injector] service gets
published, and can be retrieved using `$rootElement.injector()`.
