# form.FormController








`FormController` keeps track of all its controls and nested forms as well as the state of them,
such as being valid/invalid or dirty/pristine.

Each (form)[api/ng/directive/form] directive creates an instance
of `FormController`.







  




## Methods
### $rollbackViewValue
Rollback all form controls pending updates to the `$modelValue`.

Updates may be pending by a debounced event or because the input is waiting for a some future
event defined in `ng-model-options`. This method is typically needed by the reset button of
a form that uses `ng-model-options` to pend updates.








### $commitViewValue
Commit all form controls pending updates to the `$modelValue`.

Updates may be pending by a debounced event or because the input is waiting for a some future
event defined in `ng-model-options`. This method is rarely needed as `NgModelController`
usually handles calling this in response to input events.








### $addControl
Register a control with the form.

Input elements using ngModelController do this automatically when they are linked.








### $removeControl
Deregister a control from the form.

Input elements using ngModelController do this automatically when they are destroyed.








### $setValidity
Sets the validity of a form control.

This method will also propagate to parent forms.








### $setDirty
Sets the form to a dirty state.

This method can be called to add the 'ng-dirty' class and set the form to a dirty
state (ng-dirty class). This method will also propagate to parent forms.








### $setPristine
Sets the form to its pristine state.

This method can be called to remove the 'ng-dirty' class and set the form to its pristine
state (ng-pristine class). This method will also propagate to all the controls contained
in this form.

Setting a form back to a pristine state is often useful when we want to 'reuse' a form after
saving or resetting it.








### $setUntouched
Sets the form to its untouched state.

This method can be called to remove the 'ng-touched' class and set the form controls to their
untouched state (ng-untouched class).

Setting a form controls back to their untouched state is often useful when setting the form
back to its pristine state.








### $setSubmitted
Sets the form to its submitted state.
