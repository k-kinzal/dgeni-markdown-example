# $rootScope






* service in module []()






Every application has a single root {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope}.
All other scopes are descendant scopes of the root scope. Scopes provide separation
between the model and the view, via a mechanism for watching the model for changes.
They also provide an event emission/broadcast and subscription facility. See the
{@link guide/scope developer guide on scopes}.
